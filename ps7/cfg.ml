(* You will need to build a mapping from variables to MIPS registers
   using the ideas behind the graph-coloring register allocation
   heuristics described in class.  This may involve spilling some
   of the variables into memory, so be sure to adjust the prelude
   of the function so that you allocate enough space on the stack
   to store any spilled variables.  The output should be a CFG
   function that doesn't use any variables (except for function
   names.)
